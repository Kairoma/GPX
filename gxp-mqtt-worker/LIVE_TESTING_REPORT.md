# Live Device Testing Report - ESP32-CAM MQTT Worker

**Test Period:** October 5-7, 2025
**Device:** B8F862F9CFB8 (ESP32S3-CAM)
**Status:** Ready for Beta Launch

---

## Executive Summary

Live testing with device B8F862F9CFB8 identified and resolved three critical server-side issues. System is production-ready with optional firmware improvements recommended.

**Key Fixes:**
- Device initialization handshake implemented
- Intelligent scheduling system (test + production modes)
- JSONB sensor data consolidation (eliminated table JOINs)
- Proper capture finalization with public URLs

**Beta Readiness:** Server 100% ready. Firmware functional, optional improvements available.

---

## Critical Issues Discovered and Resolved

### 1. Missing Device Initialization Handshake (PROTOCOL-001)

**Problem:** Device sent status message but worker never responded, causing indefinite hang.

**Root Cause:** Firmware spec (pages 10-11) requires server response to status messages. Worker only polled device_commands table, never handled MQTT status messages.

**Fix:** Created `send_device_config()` in `handle_status_message()` (app.py:380-450). Worker now responds to every status message with `capture_image` or `next_wake` command based on scheduling logic. Commit: `1426ff8`

**Firmware Action:** None required - firmware behavior correct per spec.

---

### 2. Capture Finalization Incomplete (STORAGE-001)

**Problem:** Images uploaded to S3 successfully but database status stuck at "assembling" with NULL image_url.

**Evidence:**
```json
{
  "capture_id": "5acfbc1b-6db3-4a06-abfe-3f5f9f3ff5d6",
  "ingest_status": "assembling",
  "storage_path": "captures/B8F862F9CFB8/2025/10/05/image_2.jpg",
  "image_url": null
}
```

**Fix:**
- Changed status from "stored" to "success" (app.py:867)
- Added `get_public_url()` call for image_url generation (app.py:872-877)
- Commit: `1dc433f`

**Firmware Action:** None required - firmware transmission complete.

---

### 3. Device Scheduling System Missing (SCHEDULING-001)

**Problem:** No mechanism to control device wake/capture timing. All captures required manual command injection.

**Requirements:**
- Production: 12-hour intervals
- Test mode: 1-5 minute intervals
- Per-device configuration

**Fix:**

Database schema:
```sql
ALTER TABLE devices ADD COLUMN next_wake_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
ALTER TABLE device_configs
  ADD COLUMN test_mode BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  ADD COLUMN test_interval_minutes INTEGER DEFAULT 5;
```

Worker logic calculates next wake time and sends appropriate command (capture_image or next_wake with timestamp). Commits: `add_device_scheduling.sql`, `1b50b5b`

**Firmware Action Required (Recommended):**
Implement `next_wake` command handling:
```json
{
  "device_id": "B8F862F9CFB8",
  "next_wake": "2025-10-07T16:48:00Z"
}
```

Parse timestamp, calculate sleep duration, wake at specified time (±30 seconds acceptable). Fallback to default 12-hour interval if parsing fails.

---

### 4. Sensor Data Over-Engineering (SCHEMA-001)

**Problem:** Sensor data in separate table required JOINs for every query. Unnecessary complexity for time-series data always queried with captures.

**Fix:** Migrated to JSONB column in captures table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE captures ADD COLUMN sensor_data JSONB DEFAULT '{}';

-- Example:
{
  "temperature_c": 26.98,
  "humidity_pct": 56.24,
  "pressure_hpa": 1013.25,
  "gas_kohm": 45.2
}
```

Added GIN and B-tree indexes for performance. Created `captures_with_sensors` view for column-style queries. Migration: `migrate_to_jsonb_sensors.sql`, Commits: `a001942`, `c41650b`

**Benefits:** No JOINs, simpler queries, future sensors added without migrations.

**Firmware Action:** None required - firmware already publishes sensor data.

---

## Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

### 5. Metadata Redundancy (METADATA-002, Low Priority)

After initial metadata with sensor data, device sends many empty metadata messages during chunk transmission. Worker handles gracefully with upsert logic. Consider including sensor data in all messages or rate-limiting to one per second.

### 6. Chunk Retransmission Messaging (PROTOCOL-002, Low Priority)

Many duplicate empty metadata messages during retransmission. Doesn't affect functionality, just adds MQTT traffic. Consider rate-limiting.

---

## Confirmed Working Behaviors

**Image Assembly:**
- 1KB chunks transmitted and tracked correctly
- ACK messages request missing chunks
- Device retransmits as needed
- SHA256 validation working
- S3 upload successful with public URLs

**Example:** image_2.jpg - 49,272 bytes in 49 chunks, assembled in ~30 seconds

**Sensor Data:**
- BME680 temperature, humidity, pressure, gas resistance
- Stored in JSONB, validated against reasonable ranges
- Queryable with PostgreSQL JSONB operators

**Device Communication:**
- MQTT/TLS stable over hours
- Topics correct: status, data, cmd, ack
- Device responds to commands appropriately

## Firmware Recommendations for Beta

### Critical (Blocking)
None - firmware currently functional.

### Recommended (Non-Blocking)

1. **`next_wake` Command Handling (Medium Priority)**
   - Parse ISO 8601 timestamp
   - Calculate sleep duration
   - Wake at exact time
   - Fallback to 12-hour default if parsing fails

2. **Metadata Optimization (Low Priority)**
   - Include sensor data in all metadata publishes, OR
   - Rate-limit to one metadata per second during transmission

3. **Firmware Version Reporting (Low Priority)**
   - Add `firmware_version` field to status messages
   - Useful for troubleshooting and ensuring devices updated

### Optional

- Battery voltage/percentage reporting
- WiFi RSSI reporting
- Enhanced error messages (currently uses numeric codes 0-7)

## Known Limitations

1. **Assembly Timeout:** 10 minutes (49KB image typically takes 30 seconds)
2. **Concurrent Device Limit:** ~1000 devices per worker instance
3. **Storage Costs:** ~$0.08/month for 100 devices @ 24 captures/day
4. **Authentication:** MAC address only (consider JWT for production)

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Read firmware specs carefully** - Missing handshake caused 2-day delay
2. **Database simplicity wins** - JSONB eliminated JOIN complexity
3. **Live testing irreplaceable** - Simulators missed timing issues
4. **Logging is critical** - MQTT audit trail enabled rapid debugging

## Conclusion

**System Status:** Production Ready

**Server:** All critical issues resolved, live tested, deployed, stable.

**Firmware:** Core functionality working. Recommended updates non-blocking.

**Next Steps:**
1. Firmware team optionally implements next_wake command
2. Operations sets up provisioning process
3. Select 5-10 beta devices
